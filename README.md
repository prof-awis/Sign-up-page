# Voting System

This project is all about creating a Voting system
This is how the progress is so far:

## 1. Creating the Sign Up page

- Material used is from https://freefrontend.com/

- Downloaded a template and customized it.

- Then incorporated php in the file.

## 2. Creating the Database
- This involved creating the database using the localhost  phpmyadmin available in xampp

- It was followed by knowing of how to connect your database using php to your signup page so that users signing up might be saved to the database.

## 3. Creating the Login page
- Material used is from https://colorlib.com/wp/free-html5-admin-dashboard-templates/

- Customized the Nalika template.

- Connected the earlier created database to the login page. This is to help in verifcation
